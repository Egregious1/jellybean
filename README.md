This project is a learning one.
A lot of things have changed in my life one being the loss of my wife.
If I don't do something to keep my mind from wanting to destroy itself I don't know what I will do. While this will ultimately be for my own eyes only I hope on day I can at least share something about myself and her to the world in a way I never thought I would have to.

This is an ongoing project. As of now I am on medication and its been helping with keeping me focused on things that are not complete time wasters.
Who knows though I am know to lose interest as my other repos can be a very honest declaration of my lack of discipline.

All this is for you Jellybean I hope I make you proud,

-B
