					I have been using VSC to build everything. I know it is a far better experience than using emacs but
					part of me loves using the command line and terminal to do everything. I do have another laptop with
					a
					version of linux that is honestly a little bloated. I should look into that and try a different
					distro
					to make it a lot lighter. I am guessing some people would have an opinion about what that distro
					should
					be lol. As of now I just need to focus on one thing at a time. Visual Studio Code is working just
					fine
					for now I can make the whole linux thing more of a distraction hobby and less of a main thing.
					<br>
					Before I was on the medication something like that would take me into the stratisphere and back
					again
					trying to make passing ideas into reality even though the very thing that I am already working
					towards
					is right in front of my begging to be finished. Coding is def something that falls into that
					category.
					Every time I attempt to learn a language I get distracted by a completely different language or in
					this
					case OS all together. I am doing better though.
					<br>
					Things will get better...I hope.
					<br>
					I had a psych appointment today that went fairly well.I am a little stuck on where I want to go with
					this site. I almost feel as though I should just pay for a domain asap and start really being able
					to
					see my growth through this type of therapy. I want to be able to be better as a person and also give
					myself an opportunity to live the life that both my late wife and I wanted. She was taken far too
					soon
					to be able to even experience the life. She did experience the unconditional love though. on both
					ends.
					She is the only reason I am doing this, she was the only reason that I was doing anything at all to
					be
					honest. She is my entire purpose for existing and even though she is no longer on this earth I need
					to
					do everything I can to make her proud of me. She was worth every ounce of effort and she still is.
					<br>
					I love you Jellybean,

					today was an interesting day. I came to work and felt productive. I decided not to take my nootropic
					and just use the adderall that I was perscribed. I thought that I might not enjoy the change in
					temperament, but I think I am doing better with out it. I did after all spend a good amount of time
					building this website and actually making strides in learning it a lot better than I have in the
					past.
					<br>
					Christmas was a tough time as I suspect that every year from here on out is going to be that way. I
					wanted to end myself many times over the last week and I am not happy to admit even planned out a
					couple scenerios. Nothing serious, cathartic none the less.
					<br>
					back to the page. So I found some ways to better understand the whole box thing when it comes to
					objects in html and css. I am using 2px boarders to keep track of things. I also used some code and
					altered it for a simple nav bar that I will be customizing futher in order to get it where I want
					to. I am also using font awesome for some of the imaging. I am still kind of stabbing in the dark
					with a lot of these things but I feel like I am making real progress.
					<br>
					I think I should start writing down my thoughts more since I have a tough time getting my thoughts
					together in the moment. I carry around a pen and paper might as well use it.
					<br>
					I will not lie, right now this page is looking ugly as all fuck but we will get there. A lot of the
					colors and backgrounds are all temporary. I dont have a clear cut understanding on how I want this
					page to look completely as well as the layout. I am just experimenting trying to find my voice on
					this page. A bit of research will help I am sure. I am thinking about changing the whole layout for
					the navbar to be more in a documentation style. Maybe add a picture gallery. A lot of things that I
					can do to change things for the better. I will have to see what I can come up with or "steal". Being
					somewhat of an artist in a way I understand the value of stealing from other creators. Not plagerize
					of course but borrow as it were.
					<br>
					I just want to make something that my Jellybean would be proud of. I did everything for you after
					all my love.
					<br>
					Love you honey,
					-B

					Its so close to Christmas. I know you would say you didn't like to celebrate it, but in my heart I
					knew you loved that I tried to make our time together as corny and fun as possible. Even though I
					didn't care for the holiday much either.
					I just wanted to make you smile.
					I wont lie to you baby. I haven't been taking care of myself very well. I hate that I am still here.
					I am afraid to live my life without you. My heart only has enough room for you.
					Every day is a struggle to not kill myself still. I want to leave this world behind it has nothing
					left for me in it. The people I try to connect with are still the very same as I would complain
					about to you. Having an attraction to anyone that isnt even a tenth of what you were seems moronic
					and disrespectful to myself and to you my love. The things we were planning together, the life we
					were excited to live through is all gone in my heart. There is no one I wanted to have that with
					other than you. Please take me with you my love. I can't bare being apart like this.

			<em class="blog-date">9-21-23</em>

				<p>Time doesn’t feel the same with out you. Before it went by too quickly yet it felt to stand still. I
					savored every moment I could with you.
					Every touch, every kiss, every hello felt like nourishment to my soul. Now I will never experience
					those beautiful moments again.
					June 3rd 2023 was the last day I spent with you before you passed away. It still doesn’t feel real.
					I constantly hope that I’ll wake from a coma
					and see you sitting next to my bed waiting for me to wake up. I just want to talk to you again. To
					feel you again. To have a future in our
					hearts again. August 18th 2023 would have been the day we got married. I was going to surprise you
					with a trip to the church and get it done
					between you me and our friends. Then later we could have our big wedding with your whole family in
					the Philippines. It would have been a
					beautiful day. I know you would have cried the whole time but after it was over we would be able to
					call each other Mr and Mrs and mean it! We
					got so used to calling each other husband and wife and that point it really wouldn’t have changed
					much other than making it official. I loved
					you so much my little Jellybean. I still love you like you never left. I don’t think I can love
					another like I did you. You were my soul mate. I
					had never felt so at peace and so safe. I had never felt so ready to put my life on the line for
					someone before. I never wanted a family before
					you. I was ready and I couldn’t wait to meet our kids…now we never will. Its so hard to write these
					words because I know they are true.
					<br>
					I am making this blog to help get my thoughts together. As of now everything is so fragmented. I am
					also trying to pull my mind out of the
					gutter of grief and do good in the name of my beloved. She was the kindest most gentle and caring
					human I had ever met. I want to try and
					continue with her example. While I don’t think I will ever have children without her, I can at least
					try to spread goodness how ever I can. I
					will be making this website all on my own and use it to learn many new things and hopefully in time
					this might be a place for others like me to
					come and find some peace or connection to the chaos of existence.
					<br>
					I love you Jellybean
