					today was an interesting day. I came to work and felt productive. I decided not to take my nootropic and just use the adderall that I was perscribed. I thought that I might not enjoy the change in temperament, but I think I am doing better with out it. I did after all spend a good amount of time building this website and actually making strides in learning it a lot better than I have in the past.
					<br>
					Christmas was a tough time as I suspect that every year from here on out is going to be that way. I wanted to end myself many times over the last week and I am not happy to admit even planned out a couple scenerios. Nothing serious, cathartic none the less.
					<br>
					back to the page. So I found some ways to better understand the whole box thing when it comes to objects in html and css. I am using 2px boarders to keep track of things. I also used some code and altered it for a simple nav bar that I will be customizing futher in order to get it where I want to. I am also using font awesome for some of the imaging. I am still kind of stabbing in the dark with a lot of these things but I feel like I am making real progress.
					<br>
					I think I should start writing down my thoughts more since I have a tough time getting my thoughts together in the moment. I carry around a pen and paper might as well use it.
					<br>
					Love you honey,
					-B

				Its so close to Christmas. I know you would say you didn't like to celebrate it, but in my heart I knew you loved that I tried to make our time together as corny and fun as possible. Even though I didn't care for the holiday much either.
				I just wanted to make you smile.
				I wont lie to you baby. I haven't been taking care of myself very well. I hate that I am still here. I am afraid to live my life without you. My heart only has enough room for you.
				Every day is a struggle to not kill myself still. I want to leave this world behind it has nothing left for me in it. The people I try to connect with are still the very same as I would complain about to you. Having an attraction to anyone that isnt even a tenth of what you were seems moronic and disrespectful to myself and to you my love. The things we were planning together, the life we were excited to live through is all gone in my heart. There is no one I wanted to have that with other than you. Please take me with you my love. I can't bare being apart like this.

			<p>Time doesn’t feel the same with out you. Before it went by too quickly yet it felt to stand still. I savored every moment I could with you.
			 Every touch, every kiss, every hello felt like nourishment to my soul. Now I will never experience those beautiful moments again.
			June 3rd 2023 was the last day I spent with you before you passed away. It still doesn’t feel real. I constantly hope that I’ll wake from a coma 
			and see you sitting next to my bed waiting for me to wake up. I just want to talk to you again. To feel you again. To have a future in our 
			hearts again. August 18th 2023 would have been the day we got married. I was going to surprise you with a trip to the church and get it done 
			between you me and our friends. Then later we could have our big wedding with your whole family in the Philippines. It would have been a 
			beautiful day. I know you would have cried the whole time but after it was over we would be able to call each other Mr and Mrs and mean it! We 
			got so used to calling each other husband and wife and that point it really wouldn’t have changed much other than making it official. I loved 
			you so much my little Jellybean. I still love you like you never left. I don’t think I can love another like I did you. You were my soul mate. I 
			had never felt so at peace and so safe. I had never felt so ready to put my life on the line for someone before. I never wanted a family before 
			you. I was ready and I couldn’t wait to meet our kids…now we never will. Its so hard to write these words because I know they are true.
			<br>
			I am making this blog to help get my thoughts together. As of now everything is so fragmented. I am also trying to pull my mind out of the 
			gutter of grief and do good in the name of my beloved. She was the kindest most gentle and caring human I had ever met. I want to try and 
			continue with her example. While I don’t think I will ever have children without her, I can at least try to spread goodness how ever I can. I 
			will be making this website all on my own and use it to learn many new things and hopefully in time this might be a place for others like me to 
			come and find some peace or connection to the chaos of existence. 
			<br>
			I love you Jellybean
